# process

**process**: a **running** program

Virtualize CPU: time sharing

**machine state**: what a program can read or update when it is running

memory, register

**process API**: create, destroy, wait, misc control, status

**process creation**:

1. load code & static data: eagerly vs lazily
2. allocate memory for program's run-time stack & heap
3. I/O initialization

**process states**

- **Running**: In the running state, a process is running on a processor. This means it is executing instructions. 

- **Ready**: In the ready state, a process is ready to run but for some reason the OS has chosen not to run it at this given moment.
- **Blocked**: In the blocked state, a process has performed some kind of operation that makes it not ready to run until some other event takes place. A common example: when a process initiates an I/O request to a disk, it becomes blocked and thus some other process can use the processor

## process API

Unix process API

`fork()`

`wait()`

 the separation of fork() and exec() is essential in building a **UNIX shell**, because it lets the shell run code after the call to fork() but before the call to exec(); this code can alter the environment of the about-to-be-run program, and thus enables a variety of interesting features to be readily built.



**ASIDE: KEY PROCESS API TERMS** 

- Each process has a name; in most systems, that name is a number known as a process ID (PID). 

- The fork() system call is used in UNIX systems to create a new process. The creator is called the parent; the newly created process is called the child. As sometimes occurs in real life [J16], the child process is a nearly identical copy of the parent. 

- The wait() system call allows a parent to wait for its child to complete execution. 

- The exec() family of system calls allows a child to break free from its similarity to its parent and execute an entirely new program. 

- A UNIX shell commonly uses fork(), wait(), and exec() to launch user commands; the separation of fork and exec enables features like input/output redirection, pipes, and other cool features, all without changing anything about the programs being run. 

- Process control is available in the form of signals, which can cause jobs to stop, continue, or even terminate. 

- Which processes can be controlled by a particular person is encapsulated in the notion of a user; the operating system allows multiple users onto the system, and ensures users can only control their own processes. - A superuser can control all processes (and indeed do many other things); this role should be assumed infrequently and with caution for security reasons.



## Limited Direct Execution

Two questions when virtualizing hardware:

1. how to restrict operations, like I/O?
2. how to stop a process and switch to another process, i.e. time sharing?

### restrict operations - user mode & kernel mode

In **user mode**, applications do not have full access to hardware resources. 

In **kernel mode**, the OS has access to the full resources of the machine.

**trap, return-from-trap**: program execute **trap** instruction to enter kernel mode, and calls **return-from-trap** to go back to user-mode

the processor will push the program counter, flags, and a few other registers onto a per-process kernel stack; the return-fromtrap will pop these values off the stack and resume execution of the usermode program.

**trap table**: initialized on system boot, tells hardware what code to run (the location of **trap-handlers**) on exceptional events

### switching between process - time sharing

How can the operating system **regain control** of the CPU so that it can switch between processes?

#### cooperative approach

 OS trusts the processes of the system to behave reasonably. 

Most processes, as it turns out, transfer control of the CPU to the OS quite frequently by making **system calls** (e.g. open file, create new process), or make explicit **yield** system call, which does nothing except to transfer control to the OS 

#### non-cooperative approach
